# Waffle-The-search-app
Waffle App is a React-based search interface that mimics Google-like smart suggestions. As the user types into the search box, a dropdown appears with matching suggestions from a static list. The suggestions dynamically filter in real-time and disappear when focus is lost. The user can also click on a suggestion to auto-fill the input box. The dropdown is cleanly styled and positioned just below the input field.
